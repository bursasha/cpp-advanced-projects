I learned basic theoretical and implementation principles 
of the following topics: construction, use, and mutual transformations of 
finite automata, regular expressions, and regular grammars, translation 
finite automata, construction and use of pushdown automata, hierarchy of 
formal languages, relationships between formal languages and automata. 
Knowledge acquired through the module is applicable in designs of 
algorithms for searching in text, data compression, simple parsing and 
translation, and design of digital circuits. ‚öôÔ∏è

I also immersed myself in studying the basics of efficient algorithm 
design, data structures, and graph theory, belonging to the core 
knowledge of every computing curriculum. üñ•
